# Grade Management Project

## Purpose
###It is to make students to easily manage the grade themselves. I always have some trouble to find the percentage of the as or tests and
calculate again to know where i am standing.

## Function
### It allows students to create semester and courses for each semester and tasks for each courses.
 When students create tasks for each course, students should write what percentage the task contribute to the
  course grade and how many sub-tasks it has. WHen submitting each grade for subtasks, it calculates the grade of the tasks, course and semester.
