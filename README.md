# Grade Management Project

## Purpose
It is to make students to easily manage the grade themselves. I always have some trouble to find the percentage of the as or tests everytime and
calculate grade again and again to know where i am standing.

## Function
It allows students to create semester and courses for each semester and tasks for each courses.
 When students create tasks(programming as), students should write what percentage the task contribute to the
  course grade(40% among 100%) and how many sub-tasks(3 programming as) it has. When submitting each grade for subtasks, it calculates the grade for the tasks, course and semester.
